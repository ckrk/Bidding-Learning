'''
 High-Level Interface that calls learning algorithm and Energy-Market Environment
 subject to user-specified inputs

Environment Parameters

capacities:   np.array 1x(number of Agents)
costs:        np.array 1x(number of Agents)

Attention these np.arrays have to correspond to the number of Agents

Demand:       np.array 1x2
Chooses demand from arang between [min,max-1]
For fixed Demand, write: the preferred [Number, Number +1] (e.g. Demand = 99 -> [99,100])

Agents:       scalar
Number of learning agents

Rewards:      scalar
Type of Reward function. Usually 0.

Split: binary
Allow Split Bids

past_action: binary
Allow agents to learn from all agents past actions

lr_actor:    float
Learning Rate Actor


lr_critic:   float
Learning Rate Critic

Discrete:    binary
Enables Discrete Spaces (Not yet functional)
